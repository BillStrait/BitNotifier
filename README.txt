This project is a work in progress and is proved as is. 

BitNotifier queries Mt Gox every ten seconds and displays various
information about the market. It provides a system tray icon
that will display the last price when hovered over. It also supports
Logitec G15, G19, and G510 keyboards to provide ask, bid, average, and
last prices at a glance. 

It also provides a quick caluclator that allows day traders to determine
the price bitcoins will need to reach in order to break even on a short
or long purchase. In addition to the break even prices, it displays the
total number of bitcoins any given purchase will aquire, and the total
fee Mt Gox will charge for that purchase.

This project relies on the DMcLgLCD.dll file.
Support for the file is here: http://www.mangareader.com/dmclglcd.html
I have included it in the debug directory of the git, but it will need
to be placed in the same directory as the .exe in the final build.

Continued development of BitNotifier can be supported by donations to
